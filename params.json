{"name":"Hochlist.GitHub.io","tagline":"FAQ for getting started in Ho Chi Minh City","body":"## I need a cab\r\nStick to Vinasun or Mai Linh. Make sure the meter is at 11k or 12k VND when you start. Sometimes cabbies give change in batches, so don't rush out if you're shorted.\r\n\r\n## I need a SIM\r\nGo with Mobifone. Tariffs [here][1].\r\nText NN E to 901 to switch your admin language to English.\r\nTop up with 200k VND and text BMIU to 999 for 3GB high speed internet (and unlimited low speed) for a month.\r\n\r\nYou can also try KM M120, which requests the 120k VND plan for 1.5GB high speed date per month. The KM option gives you a free upgrade to the 3GB plan, saving 80k VND, but these promos can change (last verified March '15).\r\nMobifone [Account Balance & Usage Statistics][2] \\- click while connected to mobile network.\r\n\r\n## What's where? I need a map\r\n[Hoch Hotspots][3]\r\n\r\n## Where should I live?\r\nWherever you like. If you want to bump into DCers stay near [18a Nguyen Thi Minh Khai (NTMK)][4], which is the address of an alley. It's pretty easy to walk up and get a short term apartment on the same day for $200-350/month. Other than that D1 and D3 are nice and central. Further out has more new developments. Staying near Pham Ngu Lau / Bui Vien will mean street touts and backpackers.\r\n\r\n## I need an affordable hotel\r\nGood budget hotels around $20-25/day in the Dong Khoi, Japanese, and Cathedral Areas, where most DCers stay. Try the [White Lotus Hotel][6]. Lots of other cheap options if you're ok staying in the Pham Ngu Lao / Bui Vien (touristy backpacker area). Try [Golden Wind Hotel][7]\r\n\r\n## Tell me more about housing, services, and overnight guests.\r\nA lot of cheap accommodation like the ones listed above are bedsit-style rooms in a larger family house with an combined lounge / lobby. Many will lock their doors at a certain point at night. You may not get a key and they may not allow overnight visitors, so be sure to ask for details before choosing a place to stay. Also ask about things like maid service, water, laundry, as often they're included.\r\n\r\nIt's technically illegal for a Vietnamese girl to spend the night at your apartment. To avoid trouble you'll want to explicitly ask whether your landlord would allow \"your Vietnamese girlfriend\" to spend the night on occasion. You can avoid this hassle by upping your budget, renting your own apartment, or getting a houseshare. Search facebook for Ho Chi Minh housing groups or [Craigslist][8], but ask to be sure.\r\n\r\n## Where can I get some work done?\r\nSummary of [Saigon Cafes][9]\r\nFor coworking try [Work Saigon][10] (walk-in cafe space) [Start Saigon][11] (membership) or [Saigon Coworking][12]\r\n\r\n## Random Tips\r\nKeep your iPhone in your pocket big boy (and ladies even more so). Avoid riding a scooter with a purse or laptop back slung over one shoulder. Street snatchings are a thing here, mostly near the backpacker area.\r\n\r\nJoin the [Expats in Ho Chi Minh Facebook group][13] for useful info.\r\n\r\nIf you're shopping for clothes the outskirts of Ben Thanh market are much cheaper than the market itself. E.g. 50K VND for a tank top compared to 160-475K VND deep inside the market. Start haggling at 30% of original asking price.\r\n\r\n## Where can I meet the opposite sex?\r\nTry Ladies' Night @ Lush on Tuesdays\r\n\r\n## Visa Issues?\r\n**Letters:** To get a visa letter before arriving or for coming back check out the [EVisa website][14]. Use the coupon code LEGALNOMADS - thanks [Jodi!][15] If you're in country and need a visa letter / extension you can also try Thuy at +84 90 3861479 or [Phatman Visa][16] at +84 90 8311294.\r\n\r\n**Extension:** Visa rules have changed as of early 2015. Currently it's not possible to get a 3 month extension without leaving the country and 1 month extensions are expensive (~$180). Your best bet is probably a plane trip to Thailand / Singapore or a day trip by bus to the Cambodia border (see below for details). This info is likely to change, so do ask around for the latest.\r\n\r\nFor the Cambodia Bus Option do as follows [thanks Juergen][17]\r\n\r\n1. Get visa recommendation letter from visa agent ($65)\r\n2. Make sure you have passport photo and USD\r\n3. Take bus 703 that goes to Moc Bai from the bus station opposite Pham Ngu Lao 343. Leaves at 5.30am and 4.30pm. Takes 2,5 hours (40k VND each way).\r\n4. Walk to the border.\r\n5. Get exit stamp on the main building on the Vietnam side.\r\n6. Walk to the Cambodia immigration buildings on the other side of the border.\r\n7. Get entry visa Cambodia at the small buildings next to the main one ($32).\r\n8. Go inside the main Cambodia building to get the visa stamped.\r\n9. Wait for a bit.\r\n10. Get exit stamp Cambodia at those same buildings.\r\n11. Walk back to the Vietnam side of the border - go to the pink building on the left hand side of the main building.\r\n12. Get entry visa Vietnam at pink building ($45).\r\n13. Get entry visa stamped at main building. Just hand it to one of the clerks, and wait until they're done (can take a while).\r\n14. Take the same bus back to Saigon.\r\nThe whole thing takes about 8 hours and costs $142.\r\n\r\n## Where do I rent a Motorbike?\r\n: Call Tham Le on +84 90 3177407, she'll drop off a bike for you, has reasonable rates, and shouldn't insist on taking your passport.\r\n\r\n## I need a Doctor\r\nGo to [FV Hospital][18] in Bitexco tower. ~$35 for a consultation\r\n\r\nTry [these guys][19] if you need a dentist\r\n\r\n## I gotta lift bro\r\nGo to Vincharm for western-style gym and high prices. Go to the ghetto gym near 18a if you like to sweat (250k/mo). From Nguyen Thi Minh Khai take a left onto Dien Tien Hoang, then take the second entrance into the big complex on right. Stay to your left and look for white bars. Also check out this [gym map][20] for other options\r\n\r\nCheck out [Saigon Sports Club][21] out in D7 for a big gym with lots of options (MMA, BBall, Yoga, Pool, etc). 514B Huynh Tan Phat, Binh Thuan Ward, District 7. Phone: 08 37730 513\r\n\r\n## Where do I get protein / supplements?\r\nBodybuilding.vn - call if they're out of stock. They also have a local shop in D1 that you can visit for the basics. It's listed on their website.\r\n\r\n## Where can I find Computer Stuff / Electronics / Computer Repair?\r\nTry [Phong Vu on 125 Cách Mạng Tháng 8][22] or their repair shop around the corner at [31 Nguyễn Thị Diệu][23]\r\n\r\n## I'm sick of the city already, where do I go on the weekend?\r\nTry the [Vanh Thanh swimming pool][24] and resort area (busy on weekends), check out [Binh Quoi Village][25] for a park-like setting and a big buffet (Village 1 is full of newlyweds taking photos, Village 2 is a little further on the left and has a pool), or try [Saigon Outcast][26] for some hipster / urban / hip hop.. oh god, I don't even know. Vung Tau is a decent destination for a 1-2 day weekend trip to the coast.\r\n\r\n## I want to learn some Vietnamese\r\nThe [Vietnomad][27] Jeremy Ginsburg has created some cool [Vietnamese video lessons][28] (password: _JeremyGinsburgVietnamese_) free because you're special.\r\n\r\n## Are there any cinemas around?\r\nYes. Most western movies are shown in English with Vietnamese subtitles. Look [here][30] for info.\r\n\r\n## I feel so unmotivated\r\n[Namaste Cocksucka][31]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###### Brought to you by [@laverick][32], HCM DC regulars and contributors like you.\r\n###### Source [on github][33].
